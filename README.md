# Classification-Regression-Data-Analysis-Projects

## Project Description
This repository contains two predictive modeling projects demonstrating data exploration, preprocessing, and model evaluation:
1. Titanic Survival Classification
Analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset to explore data, prepare features, and build a predictive model for passenger survival. The project includes:
- data exploration and visualizations,
- handling missing values and feature preparation (standardization, encoding categorical variables),
- splitting data into training and test sets,
- building and evaluating a classification model (accuracy, F1-score),
- visualizing results and summarizing conclusions on model performance and limitations.
